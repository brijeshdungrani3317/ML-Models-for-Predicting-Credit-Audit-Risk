# ML-Models-for-Predicting-Credit-Audit-Risk
This project aims to compare various regression models to predict audit risk in firms, using a combination of basic and advanced regression techniques with hyperparameter tuning. The dataset includes financial and risk-related data of firms across different sectors, focusing on predicting the "Audit Risk" as the target variable.


# Key Components:

1.) Data Preparation and Preprocessing üóÉÔ∏è:

Merged two CSV files containing data on sector scores, risk factors, financial values, and historical information.
Cleaned and explored data, handled missing values, and applied appropriate data scaling techniques to prepare for modeling.

2.) Model Building and Comparison üîç:

Implemented a variety of regression models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Polynomial Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different kernels.
Employed Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning to identify the best model parameters.
Used cross-validation to determine the average training and testing scores for each model.

3.) Model Evaluation üìä:

Compared the performance of all regression models using plots and graphs to visualize the results.
Selected the best-performing regression model based on evaluation metrics to predict the "Audit Risk."

# Tools and Techniques Used:

Python: Core language for data analysis and model building.
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Scikit-Learn: Implementing regression models and Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for development and presentation.


**This project provides a comprehensive comparison of regression models and helps identify the best predictive model for audit risk, useful for auditors and data scientists in the financial domain. ‚Äã**
